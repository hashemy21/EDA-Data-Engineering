**Overview of used dataset**

The dataset is covering the history of the

Olympic Games, from Athens in 1896 through Rio in

2016.



**Overview the Project Goal**

The project goal is to go through complete

data engineering process:

➢Exploring the data

➢Cleaning the data

➢Data reduction

➢Handling outliers & missing values



**Steps of work done**

● We explored the dataset features

● Make sure that the data is understandable

● Discovering relations between the data

● Setting some research questions

● We started cleaning the data by:

    ○ Reducing the dimensionality of the data

    ○ Identifying outliers

    ○ Handling the missing values by placing

    them with mean/median of some specific

    data

● Then we started plotting the data by finding

the best visual to presentation



**Data Exploration Questions/RQ**

1. Women participation & performance in the Olympic games over time

2. What is the count of young, middle aged, and old atheletes

3.Participation/evolution of each sport over time

4.How the age of the participants differs over time

5.How many summer and winter season of the Olympic games in comparison, and how the number of participants changed

6.The number of medals for atheletes grouped by country


**Milestone 2 new dataset**
Removing the athletes with no medals ana keeping only the ones 
with medals and merging the medals.xlsx file so that each
athlete included the medals that his/her team won for each year


**Milestone 2 new features**

1. One hot encoding on the medals column so that the type of medal could be visualized easily and change categorical data to numeric
2. Discretize the age attribute into young, middle aged, and old so that future applications could be applied easily when focusing on a certain range of ages.
